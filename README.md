# Individual part------Perlin Noise

In this part, I use Perlin Noise Technology to make the artwork we abstract have a dynamic effect.
All elements on the canva move separately, but follow a rule in a whole level, 
the elements will rotate in a small range from the start point.

All the technology I use are from the tutorial. :D
