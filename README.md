I’m very interested in the liquefaction style shown in these two pictures. It’s an ideal approach for my major project because it’s both feasible and visually impactful. This stylish and cutting-edge effect brings a fresh, modern feel to the design, making it engaging and novel for the audience.

The coding techniques in the link can help us apply a liquefaction effect to the entire image created by our group. After that, I plan to divide the image into sections and add animation effects to enhance the overall design.Create an effect where the large contains the small, and the small contains the large.
